This document contains the plans for the project without going into their specific implementation details.
The details can be found in the plan.txt file of the directories.

Steps:
    1. Acquire all movie script html
    2. Train a model that can differentiate between dialogue and stage directions
    2. Use structure present in most scripts to create a model that can identify dialogue from stage driections


1. Acquire all movie script html
    Use The Internet Movie Script Database (https://imsdb.com/). Go through all the movies there and get their scripts.
    Save the html tag that contains the script directly without doing any extraction.
        (There is a specific css class consistently used to contain the script: scr-text)
        (Extraction is not done as errors in extraction would require the process to be restarted, increasing traffic)

2. Train a model that can differentiate between dialogue and stage directions
    Most scripts have some structure where dialogue and stage directions have different levels of indentation.
    To get the most data to train a model later, I would like to utilize the scripts without structure as well.
    For this purpose I will train a model that will identify if a line is stage directions or dialogue from the text.
