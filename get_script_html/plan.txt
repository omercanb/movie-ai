Steps:
    1. Getting to a movie's script page.
    2. Getting the html tag which contains the script.
    3. Saving the html to a file

1. Getting to a movie's script page:

https://imsdb.com/all-scripts.html contains links to all movies' pages. 
    Movie Page Example: https://imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/10 Things I Hate About You Script.html
The movie's page then contains a link to it's script.
    Script Page Example: https://imsdb.com/scripts/10-Things-I-Hate-About-You.html

Going directly from the "all scripts" page to the movies script page will be faster than first navigating to the
movie page and then to the script page as it will need one less get request.

The title of the movie on the "all scripts" page looks like it might always match its script page's url.
    For example:
        10 Things I Hate About You Script -> https://imsdb.com/scripts/10-Things-I-Hate-About-You.html
    Also in the case of titles with 'The':
        Abyss, The -> https://imsdb.com/scripts/Abyss,-The.html
Replacing the spaces with a dash and visiting that page from the url "https://imsdb.com/scripts/" should lead to the 
correct page.
If it does not I will raise an error to see. 
I will make a decision based on for how many scripts this rule doesn't hold. 

To see if it does not lead to the correct page, firstly, 
all urls in the form https://imsdb.com/scripts/<anything>.html are valid and have the same html of an empty script page.
So I will compare the html with existing html of an empty script page to see if it is empty.

If an exception occurs, the last url will be saved to a file. I suspect exceptions will be common because of requests.


2. Getting the html tag which contains the script:

    All pages that I have checked include the script under a tag of class scrtext.
    However this tag generally contains additional html outside of the script.

    The script itself is contained in a pre tag under this tag.
    But it is not guaranteed that there will be one pre tag.

    Because I want to make the minimum amount of http requests required I will just save all the html contained under
    the scrtext class and do the processing to extract the script later on my local files.
    This way, if I make a mistake in the extraction of the script, I will not have to do get requests again.


3. Saving the html to a file:
    Writing the title and url for later use.
    Writing the correct html tag and children as a string to files of movie names.
