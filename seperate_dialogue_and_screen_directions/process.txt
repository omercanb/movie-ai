Steps:
    1. Choose a method of identifying wether a text is correctly indented and can be used to create the dataset
    2. Split the lines as such


The cutoff for movies with just one indent level was a max frequency of 0.92, A film titles burning annie was the cutoff,
the films with higher max frequency had only one indentation level.

To determine if a movie is formatted in such a way that the most two frequent indetation levels are the dialogue and the
screen directions, I intially thought of doing a similar cutoff frequency for the sum of the two max frequencies. At 0.85
frequency there started to be issues where there were not exactly two indentation levels but were still identified by 
them always being more indented than the screen directions. Here I got the tought of finding an average indentation level
and indents above it would be dialoge and below would be screen directions. 
This may lower the quality of data. But when the cutoff is 0.9, 258 movies are lost. Additionally the lines which are
not indented at any of the max two levels are also lost. Therefore I think it will be worth to use an average indent.
I also chose a cutoff of 0.3. This only eliminated 3 movies, all of which seemed to be formatted quite absrudly.
