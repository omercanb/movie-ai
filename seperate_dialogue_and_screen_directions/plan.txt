Steps:
    1. Choose a method of identifying wether a text is correctly indented and can be used to create the dataset
    2. Split the lines as such

1. Choose a method of identifying wether a text is correctly indented and can be used to create the dataset
    Firstly I want to make sure that all lines are not at the same level.
    So I will get the most frequent line indentation and make sure that its frequency is below a threshold.
    Then I will get the next most frequent line indentation and make sure the sum of these two frequencies are above 
    another threshold.
    If this holds, then the text will be correctly indented. I will also have the lines that are correctly indented ready.
