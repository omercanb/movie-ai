Steps:
    1. Remove text that isn't part of the script.
    2. Get the remaining text, removing all tags.
    3. Remove empty lines and parantheses


1. Remove text that isn't part of the script.
    All scripts have a table at the displaying info about the movie.
    This is the only unneccessary text

2. Get the remaining text, removing all tags.
    The html partsing library has a method for this.

3. Remove empty lines
Empty lines have no use
The only type of parantheses I want to remove are lines that are only parantheses as these have irreguar indenting and
do not provide information towards categorizing a line.
Any parantheses that are part of a line can be helpful in identifying the category of that line.
