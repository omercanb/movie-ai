Steps:
    1. Remove text that isn't part of the script.
    2. Get the remaining text, removing all tags.
    3. Remove parantheses and empty lines


1. Remove text that isn't part of the script.
    All scripts have a table at the displaying info about the movie.
    This is the only unneccessary text

2. Get the remaining text, removing all tags.
    The html partsing library has a method for this.

3. Remove parantheses and empty lines
Lines of parantheses tend to have weird indenting and are not useful for analysis of stage direction vs dialogue
Empty lines also have no use
